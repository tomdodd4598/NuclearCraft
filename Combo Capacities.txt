The Combo Capacity of a fuel combination is the RF produced by one fuel cell of each fuel, containing 100000 fuel units each, in a size 1 fusion reactor at 100% efficiency:
comboCapacity = 100000*fusionRF*powerVariable/fuelUsage
Where 'fusionRF' is the fusion reactor's Power Generation config value and 'powerVariable' is the Power Variable of the fuel combination.
The 'fuelUsage' is the number of fuel units used by the fusion reactor per tick:
fuelUsage = 100*fuelVariable/fusionEfficiency,
Where 'fuelVariable' is the fuel combo's Fuel Variable and 'fusionEfficiency' is the fusion reactor's Fuel Efficiency config value.
The overall equation is therefore:
comboCapacity = 1000*fusionRF*powerVariable*fusionEfficiency/fuelVariable
The Power Variables and Fuel Variables are all configurable in the fusion config file.
